# Bort - Bus or Tram

This app displays the 5 next departure times for public transport of two hard-coded stops. 

## Running the application

Easiest way to run these applications is by using `docker compose`. The app can also be run by first starting the backend and then the frontend. Don't forget to add .env files!
